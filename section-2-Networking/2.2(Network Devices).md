## Network Devices
### Network devices
- Many different devices and components
	- all have different roles
- Some of these functions are combined together
	- wireless router/switch/firewall
- Compare different devices
	- Understand when they should be used

### Routers
- Routers traffic between IP subnets
	- Makes forwarding decisions based on IP address
	- Routers inside of switches sometimes called "layer 3 switches"
- Often connects diverse network types
	- LAN, WAN, Copper, fiber

### Switches
- Bridging done in hardware
	- Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
	- Forwards traffic based on data link address
- Many Ports and features
	- The core of an enterprise network
	- May provide Power over Ethernet (PoE)
- Multilayer switch
	- Includes routing functionality

Unmanaged switches
- Very few configuration options
	- plug and play
- Fixed configuration
	- No VLANs
- very little integration with other devices
	- No management protocols
- Low price point
	- simple is less expensive

### Managed switches
- VLAN support
	- Interconnect with other switches via 802.1Q
- Traffic prioritization
	- voice traffic gets a higher priority
- Redundancy support 
	- Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
- Port mirroring
	- capture packets
- External management
	- simple network management protocol (SNMP)

### Access point
- Not a wireless router
	- A wireless router is a router and an access point in a single device
- An access point is a bridge
	- Extends the wired network onto the wireless network
	- Makes forwarding decisions based on MAC address

### Cable infrastructure

### Patch Panels
- Communication of punch-down blocks and RJ-45 connectors
- Runs from desks are made once
	- Permanently punched down to patch panel
- Patch panel to switch can be easily changed
	- No special tools 
	- use existing cables

### Firewalls
- Filters traffic by port number
	- OSI layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
		- Some firewalls can filter based on the application
- Can encrypt traffic into/out of the network
	- Protect your traffic between sites
- Can proxy traffic
	- A common security technique
- Most firewalls can be layer 3 devices (routers)
	- usually sits on the ingress/egress of the network

### Power over Ethernet (PoE)
