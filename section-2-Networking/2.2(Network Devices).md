## Network Devices
### Network devices
- Many different devices and components
	- all have different roles
- Some of these functions are combined together
	- wireless router/switch/firewall
- Compare different devices
	- Understand when they should be used

### Routers
- Routers traffic between IP subnets
	- Makes forwarding decisions based on IP address
	- Routers inside of switches sometimes called "layer 3 switches"
- Often connects diverse network types
	- LAN, WAN, Copper, fiber

### Switches
- Bridging done in hardware
	- Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
	- Forwards traffic based on data link address
- Many Ports and features
	- The core of an enterprise network
	- May provide Power over Ethernet (PoE)
- Multilayer switch
	- Includes routing functionality

Unmanaged switches
- Very few configuration options
	- plug and play
- Fixed configuration
	- No VLANs
- very little integration with other devices
	- No management protocols
- Low price point
	- simple is less expensive

### Managed switches
- VLAN support
	- Interconnect with other switches via 802.1Q
- Traffic prioritization
	- voice traffic gets a higher priority
- Redundancy support 
	- Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
- Port mirroring
	- capture packets
- External management
	- simple network management protocol (SNMP)

### Access point
- Not a wireless router
	- A wireless router is a router and an access point in a single device
- An access point is a bridge
	- Extends the wired network onto the wireless network
	- Makes forwarding decisions based on MAC address

### Cable infrastructure

### Patch Panels
- Communication of punch-down blocks and RJ-45 connectors
- Runs from desks are made once
	- Permanently punched down to patch panel
- Patch panel to switch can be easily changed
	- No special tools 
	- use existing cables

### Firewalls
- Filters traffic by port number
	- OSI layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
		- Some firewalls can filter based on the application
- Can encrypt traffic into/out of the network
	- Protect your traffic between sites
- Can proxy traffic
	- A common security technique
- Most firewalls can be layer 3 devices (routers)
	- usually sits on the ingress/egress of the network

### Power over Ethernet (PoE)
- Power provided on an Ethernet cable
	- one wire for both network and electricity
	- Phones, cameras, wireless access points
	- useful in difficult-to-power areas
- Power provided at the switch
	- Built-in power - End spans
	- In-line power injector - Mid spans

### PoE switch
- Power over Ethernet
	- commonly marked on the switch or interfaces

### PoE, PoE+, PoE++
- PoE : IEEE 802.3af-2003
	- The original PoE specification
	- Now part of the 802.3 standard
	- 15.4 watts DC power, 350 mA max current
- PoE+ : IEEE 802.3at-2009
	- Now also part of the 802.3 standard
	- 25.5 watts DC power, 600 mA max current
- PoE++ : IEEE 802.3bt-2018
	- 51 W (Type 3), 600 mA max current
	- 71.3 W (Type 4), 960 mA max current
	- PoE with 10GBASE-T

### Hub
- "Multi-port repeater"
	- traffic going in one port is repeated to every other port
- Everything is half-duplex
- Becomes less efficient as network traffic increases
- 10 megabit / 100 megabit
- Difficult to find today

### Cable Modem
- Broadband
	- transmission across multiple frequencies
	- different traffic types
- Data on the "cable" network
	- DOCSIS
		- (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification)
- High-speed networking
	- speeds up to 1 Gigabit /s are available
- Multiple Services
	- Data, voice, video

### DSL modem
- ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)
	- Uses telephone lines
- Download speed is faster than the upload speed (asymmetric)
	- ~10,000 foot limitation from the central office (CO)
	- 52 Mbit/s downstream / 16Mbit/s upstream are common
	- Faster speeds may be possible if closer to the CO

### ONT
- Optical network terminal
	- fiber to the premises
- connect the ISP fiber network to the copper network
	- Demarcation point ( demarc ) in the data center
	- terminal box on the side of the building
- Line of responsibility
	- one side of the box is the ISP
	- Other side of the box is your network

### Network Interface Card (NIC)
- The fundamental network device
	- Every device on the network has a NIC
	- Computers, servers, printers, routers, switches, phones, tablets, cameras, etc.
- Specific to the network type
	- Ethernet, WAN, wireless, etc.
- Often built-in to the motherboard
	- Or added as an expansion card
- Many options
	- single port, multi-port, copper, fiber

## Software Defined Networking

### SDN (Software Defined Networking)
- Networking devices have different functional planes of operation
	- Data, control, and managements planes
- Split the functions into separate logical units
	- Extend the functionality and management of a single device
	- perfectly built for the cloud
- Infrastructure layer / Data plane
	- Process the network frames and packets
	- Forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT
- Control layer / Control plane
	- Manages the actions of the data plane
	- Routing tables, session tables, NAT tables
	- Dynamic routing protocol updates
- Application layer / Management plane
	- Configure and manage the device
	- SSH, browser, API
