## DNS Configuration
### Domain Name System
- Translates human-readable names into computer-readable IP addresses
	- You only need to remember www.ProfessorMesser.com
- Hierarchical
	- Follow the path
- Distributed database
	- Many DNS servers
	- 13 root server clusters (Over 1,000 actual servers)
	- Hundreds of generic top-level domains (gTLDs) - .com, .org, .net, etc.
	- Over 275 country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) - .us, .ca, .uk, etc.

### The DNS hierarchy

### DNS records
- Resource Records (RR)
	- The database records of domain name services
- Over 30 record types
	- IP addresses, certificates, host alias names, etc.
- These are important and critical configurations
	- Make sure to check your settings, backup, and test !

### Address records (A) (AAAA)
- Defines the IP address of a host
	- this is the most popular query
- A records are for IPv4 addresses
	- Modify the A record to change the host name to IP address resolution
- AAAA records are for IPv6 addresses
	- The same DNS server, different records
*www.peofessormesser.com. IN A 162.159.246.164 ; Professor Messer*

### Mail exchanger record (MX)
- Determines the host name for the mail server
	- This isn't an IP address; it's a name

- ; This is the mail-exchanger. You can list more than one (if applicable),
- ; with the integer field indicating priority (lowest 
- ; being a higher priority)
*IN MX mail.mydomain.name*
- ; A list of machine names & addresses
	- *jack.mydomain.name.  IN A  123.12.41.40  ;  Windows 10*
	- *mail.mydomain.name.  IN A  123.12.41.41  ;  Linux(main server)*
	- *sam.mydomain.name.  IN A  123.12.41.42  ;  Windows 11*

### Text records (TXT)
- Human-readable text information
	- Useful public information
	- Was originally designed for informal information
- Can be used for verification purposes
	- If you have access to the DNS, then you must be the administrator of the domain name
- Commonly used for email security
	- External email servers validate information from your DNS

### Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
- SPF protocol
	- A list of all servers authorized to send emails for this domain
	- Prevent mail spoofing
	- Mail servers perform a check to see if incoming mail really did come from an authorized host

### Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)
- Digitally sign a domain's outgoing mail
	- Validated by mail servers, not usually seen by the end user
	- The public key is the DKIM TXT record

### DMARC
- Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)
	- Prevent unauthorized email use (spoofing)
	- An extensio
