## Network Tools
- "Pinch" the connector onto a wire
	- Coaxial, twisted pair, fiber
- Connect the modular connector to the Ethernet cable
	- The final step of the process
- Metal prongs are pushed through the insulation
	- The plug is also permanently pressed onto the cable sheath

### Modular connectors

### Crimping best-practices
- Get a good crimper
	- And a good pair of electrician's scissors / cable snips
	- And a good wire stripper
- Make sure you use the correct modular connectors
	- Differences between wire types
- Practice, practice, practice
	- It won't take long to become proficient

### Wi-Fi analyzer
- Wireless networks are incredibly easy to monitor
	- Everyone "hears" everything
- Purpose-built hardware or mobile device add-on
	- Specializes in 802.11 analysis
- Identify errors and interference
	- Validate antenna location and installation

### Tone generator
- Toner probe
	- Where does that wire go ?
	- Follow the tone
- Tone generator
	- Puts an analog sound on the wire
- Inductive probe
	- Doesn't need to touch the copper
	- Hear through a small speaker

### Using the tone generator and probe
- Easy wire tracing
	- Even in complex environments
- Connect the tone generator to the wire
	- Modular jack
	- Coax
	- Punch down connectors
- Use the probe to locate the sound
	- The two-tone sound is easy to find

### Punch down tool
- "Punch" a wire into a wiring block 
	- 66 block, 110 block, and others
- Can be tedious
	- Every wire must be individually punched

### Punch-down best-practices
- Organization is key
	- Lots of wires
	- Cable management
- Maintain your twists
	- Your category 6A cable will thank you later
- Document everything
	- Written documentation
	- Tags
	- Graffiti

### Cable testers
- Relatively simple
	- Continuity test
	- A simple wire map
- Can identity missing pins
	- Or crossed wires
- Not usually used for frequency testing
	- Crosstalk, signal loss, etc.

### Loopback plugs
- Useful for testing physical ports
	- Or fooling your applications
- Serial / RS-232 (9 pin or 25 pin)
- Network connections
	- Ethernet, T1, Fiber
- These are not cross-over cables

### Taps and port mirrors
- Intercept network traffic
	- Send a copy to a packet capture device
- Physical taps
	- Disconnect the link, put a tap in the middle
	- Can be an active or passive tap
- Port mirror
	- Port redirection, SPAN(Switched Port Analyzer)
	- Software-based tap
	- Limited funtionality, but can work
