## IPv4 and IPv6

### IP addressing
- IPv4 is the primary protocol for everything we do
	- Included in almost all configurations
- IPv6 is now part of all major operating systems
	- And the backbone of our internet infrastructure

### IPv4 addresses
- Internet Protocol version 4
	- OSI layer 3 address
	- ![[Pasted image 20250402051616.png]]
	-Since one byte is 8 bits, the maximum decimal value for each byte is 255.

### IPv6 addresses
- Internet Protocol v6 - 128-bit address
	- 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses (340 undecillion)
	- 6.8 billion people could have 5000000000000000000000000000

- Your DNS is very important !
- First 64 bits is generally the network prefix (/64)
- Last 64 bits is then the host network address

### Networking with IPv4
- IP Address, e.g., 192.168.1.165
	- Every device needs a unique IP address
- Subnet mask, e.g., 255.255.255.0
	- used by the local device to determine what subnet it's on
		- The subnet mask isn't (usually) transmitted across the network
		- You'll ask for the subnet mask all the time
	- What's the subnet mask of this network?
- Default gateway, e.g., 192.168.1.1
	- The router that allows you to communicate outside of your local subnet
	- The default gateway must be an IP address on the local subnet
