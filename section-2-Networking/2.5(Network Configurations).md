## IPv4 and IPv6

### IP addressing
- IPv4 is the primary protocol for everything we do
	- Included in almost all configurations
- IPv6 is now part of all major operating systems
	- And the backbone of our internet infrastructure

### IPv4 addresses
- Internet Protocol version 4
	- OSI layer 3 address
	- ![[Pasted image 20250402051616.png]]
	-Since one byte is 8 bits, the maximum decimal value for each byte is 255.

### IPv6 addresses
- Internet Protocol v6 - 128-bit address
	- 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses (340 undecillion)
	- 6.8 billion people could have 5000000000000000000000000000

- Your DNS is very important !
- First 64 bits is generally the network prefix (/64)
- Last 64 bits is then the host network address

### Networking with IPv4
- IP Address, e.g., 192.168.1.165
	- Every device needs a unique IP address
- Subnet mask, e.g., 255.255.255.0
	- used by the local device to determine what subnet it's on
		- The subnet mask isn't (usually) transmitted across the network
		- You'll ask for the subnet mask all the time
	- What's the subnet mask of this network?
- Default gateway, e.g., 192.168.1.1
	- The router that allows you to communicate outside of your local subnet
	- The default gateway must be an IP address on the local subnet

### DNS Servers
- We remember names
	- professormesser.com, google.com, youtube.com
- Internet routers don't know names
	- Routers only know IP addresses
- Something has to translate between names and IP addresses
	- Domain Name Services
- You configure two DNS servers in your IP configuration 
	- That's how important it is

## Assigning IP Addresses

### DHCP
- IPv4 address configuration used to be manual
	- IP address, subnet mask, gateway, DNS servers, NTP servers, etc.
- October 1993 - The bootstrap protocol
	- BOOTP
- BOOTP didn't automatically define everything
	- Some manual configurations were still required
	- BOOTP also didn't know when an IP address might be available again
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
	- Initially released in 1997, updated through the years
	- Provides automatic address / IP configuration for almost all the devices

### DHCP Process
- DORA
	- A four-step process
- Discover
	- Find a DHCP server
- Offer
	- Get an offer
- Request 
	- Lock in the offer
- Acknowledge
	- DHCP server confirmation

### Step 1 : Discover

### Step 2 : Offer

### Step 3 : Request

### Step 4 : Acknowledge

### Turning dynamic into static
- DHCP assigns an IP addresses from the first available from a large pool of addresses
	- Your IP address will occasionally change
- You may not want your IP address to change
	- Server, Printer, or personal preference
- Disable DHCP on the device
	- Configure the IP address information manually
	- Requires additional administration
- Better : Configure an IP reservation on the DHCP server
	- Associate a specific MAC address with an IP address

### Avoid manual configuration
- No DHCP server reservation
	- You configure the IP address manually
- Difficult to change  later
	- You must visit the device again
- A DHCP reservation is preferable
	- Change the IP address from the DHCP server

### Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
- A link-local address
	- No forwarding by routers
- IETF has reserved 169.254.0.0 through 169.254.255.255
	- First and last 256 addresses are reserved
	- Functional block of 169.254.1.0 through 169.254.254.255
- Automatically assigned
	- Uses ARP to confirm t
