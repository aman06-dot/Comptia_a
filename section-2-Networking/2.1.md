# Ports and Protocols

## Introduction to IP
---
### A series of moving vans
- Efficiently move large amounts of data
	- Use a shipping truck
- The network topology is the road
	- Ethernet, DSL, cable system
- The truck is the Internet Protocol(IP)
	- We've designed the roads for this truck
- The boxes hold your data
	- Boxes of TCP and UDP
- Inside the boxes are more things
	- application information 

### IP - Internet Protocol
![[Pasted image 20250330193840.png]]

### TCP and UDP
- Transported inside of IP
	- Encapsulated by the IP protocol
- Two ways to move data from place to place
	- Different features for different applications
- OSI layer 4
	- The transport layer
- Multiplexing
	- Use many different applications at the same time
	- TCP and UDP

### TCP-Transmission Control Protocol
- Connection-oriented
	- A formal connection setup and close
- "Reliable" delivery
	- Recovery from errors
	- can manage out of order messages or retransmissions
- Flow control
	- The receiver can manage how much data is sent 
- ![[Pasted image 20250330194814.png]]

### UDP - User Datagram Protocol
- Connectionless
	- No formal open or close to the connection
- "Unreliable" delivery
	- No error recovery
	- No reordering of data or retransmissions
- No flow control
	- Sender determines the amount of data transmitted
- ![[Pasted image 20250330194947.png]]

### Why would you ever use UDP?
- Real-time communication
	- There's no way to stop and resend the data
	- Time doesn't stop for your network
- Connectionless protocols
	- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
	- TFTP(Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
- The data might not get through
	- The application keeps track and decides what to do
	- It might not do anything

### Communication using TCP
- Connection-oriented protocols prefer a "return receipt"
	- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
	- SSH (Secure Shell)
- The application doesn't worry about out of order frames or missing data
	- TCP handles all of the communication overhead
	- The application has one job

### Speedy Delivery
- The IP delivery truck delivers from one (IP) address to another (IP) address
	- Every house has an address, every computer has an IP address
- Boxes arrive at the house / IP address
	- Where do the boxes go ?
	- Each box has a room name
- Port is written on the outside of the box
	- Drop the box into the right room

### Lots of ports
- IPv4 sockets
	- Server IP address, protocol, server application port number
	- Client IP address, protocol, client port number
- Non-ephemeral ports-permanent port numbers
	- Ports 0 through 1023
	- Usually on a server or service
- Ephemeral ports temporary port numbers
	- Ports 1024 through 65,535
	- Determined in real-time by the client

### Port numbers
- TCP and UDP ports can be any number between 0 and 65,535
- Most servers (services) use non-ephemeral (not-temporary) port numbers
	- This isn't always the case
		- it's just a number
- Port numbers are for communication, not security
- Service port numbers need to be "well known"
- TCP port numbers aren't the same as UDP port numbers

### Ports on the network
- Web server - tcp/80
- VoIP server - udp/5004
- Email server - tcp/143

## Common Network Ports
---
### Port numbers
- Well-known port number
	- Client and server need to match
- Important for firewall rules
	- Port-based security
- A bit of rote memorization
	- Becomes second nature after a while
- Make sure you know port number, protocol, and how the protocol is used

### FTP- File Transfer Protocol
-    tcp/20 (active mode data),
	tcp/21 (control)
		- Transfers files between systems
- Authenticates with a username and password
	- some systems use a generic/anonymous login
- Full-featured functionality
	- List, add, delete, etc.

### SSH - Secure Shell
- Encrypted communication link - tcp/22
- Looks and acts the same as Telnet
- ![[Pasted image 20250330220615.png]]

### Telnet
- Telnet - Telecommunication Network - tcp/23
- Login to devices remotely - Console access
- In-the-clear communication
	- Not the best choice for production systems
- ![[Pasted image 20250330220722.png]]

### SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
	- Server to server email transfer
	- tcp/25
- Also used to send mail from a device to a mail server
	- Commonly configured on mobile devices and email
- Other protocols are used for clients to receive email
	- IMAP, POP3

DNS - Domain Name System
- Converts names to IP addresses - udp/53
	- www.professormesser.com = 162.159.246.164
- These are very critical resources
	- Usually multiple DNS servers are in production

### DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
- Automated configuration of IP address, subnet mask and other options
- udp/67, udp/68
- Requires a DHCP server
	- Server, appliance, integrated into a SOHO router, etc.
- Dynamic / pooled
	- IP addresses are assigned in real-time from a pool
	- Each system is given a lease and must renew at set intervals
- DHCP reservation
	- Addresses are assigned by MAC address in the DHCP server
	- Manage addresses from one location

### HTTP and HTTPS
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol
	- Communication in the browser
	- And by other applications
- In the clear or encrypted
	- Supported by nearly all web servers and clients
- ![[Pasted image 20250330222242.png]]

### POP3/IMAP
- Receive emails from an email server
	- Authenticate and transfer
- POP3 - Post office Protocol version 3
	- tcp/110
	- Basic mail transfer functionality
- IMAP4 - Internet Message Access Protocol v4
	- tcp/143
	- Includes management of email inbox from multiple clients

### SMB - Server Message Block
- Protocol used by Microsoft Windows
	- File sharing, Printer sharing
	- Also called CIFS (Common Internet File System)
- Using NetBIOS over TCP/IP (Network Basic Input/Output System)
	- udp/137 - NetBIOS name services (nbname)
	- tcp/139 - NetBIOS session services (nbsession)
- Direct over tcp/445 (NetBIOS-less)
	- Direct SMB communication over TCP without the NetBIOS transport

### SNMP - Simple Network Management Protocol
- Gather statistics from network devices
	- Queries: udp/161
	- Traps: udp/162
