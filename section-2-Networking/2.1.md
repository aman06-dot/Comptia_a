# Ports and Protocols

## Introduction to IP
---
### A series of moving vans
- Efficiently move large amounts of data
	- Use a shipping truck
- The network topology is the road
	- Ethernet, DSL, cable system
- The truck is the Internet Protocol(IP)
	- We've designed the roads for this truck
- The boxes hold your data
	- Boxes of TCP and UDP
- Inside the boxes are more things
	- application information 

### IP - Internet Protocol

### TCP and UDP
- Transported inside of IP
	- Encapsulated by the IP protocol
- Two ways to move data from place to place
	- Different features for different applications
- OSI layer 4
	- The transport layer
- Multiplexing
	- Use many different applications at the same time
	- TCP and UDP

### TCP-Transmission Control Protocol
- Connection-oriented
	- A formal connection setup and close
- "Reliable" delivery
	- Recovery from errors
	- can manage out of order messages or retransmissions
- Flow control
	- The receiver can manage how much data is sent
