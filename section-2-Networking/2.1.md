# Ports and Protocols

## Introduction to IP
---
### A series of moving vans
- Efficiently move large amounts of data
	- Use a shipping truck
- The network topology is the road
	- Ethernet, DSL, cable system
- The truck is the Internet Protocol(IP)
	- We've designed the roads for this truck
- The boxes hold your data
	- Boxes of TCP and UDP
- Inside the boxes are more things
	- application information 

### IP - Internet Protocol

### TCP and UDP
- Transported inside of IP
	- Encapsulated by the IP protocol
- Two ways to move data from place to place
	- Different features for different applications
- OSI layer 4
	- The transport layer
- Multiplexing
	- Use many different applications at the same time
	- TCP and UDP

### TCP-Transmission Control Protocol
- Connection-oriented
	- A formal connection setup and close
- "Reliable" delivery
	- Recovery from errors
	- can manage out of order messages or retransmissions
- Flow control
	- The receiver can manage how much data is sent

### UDP - User Datagram Protocol
- Connectionless
	- No formal open or close to the connection
- "Unreliable" delivery
	- No error recovery
	- No reordering of data or retransmissions
- No flow control
	- Sender determines the amount of data transmitted

### Why would you ever use UDP?
- Real-time communication
	- There's no way to stop and resend the data
	- Time doesn't stop for your network
- Connectionless protocols
	- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
	- TFTP(Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
- The data might not get through
	- The application keeps track and decides what to do
	- It might not do anything

### Communication using TCP
- Connection-oriented protocols prefer a "return receipt"
	- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
	- SSH (Secure Shell)
- The application doesn't worry about out of order frames or missing data
	- TCP handles all of the communication overhead
	- The application has one job

### Speedy Delivery
- The IP delivery truck delivers from one (IP) address to another (IP) address
	- Every house has an address, every computer has an IP address
- Boxes arrive at the house / IP address
	- Where do the boxes go ?
	- Each box has a room name
- Port is written on the outside of the box
	- Drop the box into the right room

### Lots of ports
