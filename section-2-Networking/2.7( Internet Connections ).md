	- 50 Mbit/s down, 3Mbit/s up are common
	- Remote sites, difficult-to-network sites
- High latency
	- 250ms up, 250ms down
	- Starlink advertises 40ms and is working on 20ms
- High frequencies - 2GHz
	- Line of sight, rain fade

### Fiber
- High speed data communication
	- Frequencies of light
- Higher installation cost than copper
	- Equipment is more costly
	- More difficult to repair
	- Communicate over long distances
- Large installation in the WAN core
	- Supports very high data rates
	- SONET, wavelength division multiplexing
- Fiber is slowly approaching the premises
	- Business and home use
