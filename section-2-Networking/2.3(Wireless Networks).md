## Wireless Network Standards

### Wireless standards
- Wireless networking (802.11)
	- Managed by the IEEE LAN/MAN standards committee (IEEE 802)
- Many updates over time
	- Checked with IEEE for the latest
- The Wi-Fi trademark 
	- Wi-Fi Alliance handles interoperability testing

### 802.11a
- One of the original 802.11 wireless standards
	- October 1999
- Operates in the 5Ghz range
	- Or other frequencies with special licensing
- 54 megabits per second (Mbit/s)
- Smaller range than 802.11b
	- higher frequency is absorbed by objects in the way
- Not commonly seen today

### 802.11b
- Also an original 802.11 standard
	- October 1999
- Operates in the 2.4 GHz range
- 11 megabits per second (Mbit/s)
- Better range than 802.11a
	- less absorption problems
- More frequency conflict
	- Baby monitors, cordless phones, microwave ovens, Bluetooth
- Not commonly seen today

### 802.11g
- An "upgrade" to 802.11b
	- june 2003
- operates in the 2.4 GHz range
- 54 megabits per second (Mbit/s)
	- Similar to 802.11a
- Backwards-compatible with 802.11b
- Same 2.4 GHz frequency conflict problems as 802.11b

### 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)
- The update to 802.11g, 802.11b, and 802.11a
	- October 2009
- operates at 5 GHz and/or 2.4 GHz
	- 40 MHz channel widths
- 600 megabits per second (Mbit/s)
	- 40 MHz mode and 4 antennas
- 802.11n uses MIMO
	- Multiple-input multiple-output
	- Multiple transmit and receive antennas

### 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)
- Approved in January 2014
	- Significant improvement over 802.11n
- Operates in the 5 GHz band
	- less crowded, more frequencies (up to 160 MHz channel bandwidth)
- Increased channel bonding
	- larger bandwidth usage
- Denser signaling modulation
	- faster data transfers
- Eight MU-MIMO downlink streams
	- Twice as many streams as 802.11n
	- Nearly 7 gigabits per second

### 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)
- Approved in February 2021
	- The successor to 802.11ac/Wi-Fi 5
- Operates at 5GHz and/or 2.4 GHz
	- 20, 40, 80 and 160 MHz channel widths
- 1201 megabits per second per channel
	- A relatively small increase in throughput
	- Eight bi-directional MU-MIMO streams
- Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)
	- Works similar to cellular communication
	- Improve high-density installations

### Long-range fixed wireless
- Wireless access point in a house with the stock antennas
	- you might get a range of 40 to 50 meters
- Try connecting two buildings located miles from each other
	- Fixed directional antennas and increased signal strength
- Outdoors
	- Minimal signal absorption or bounce
- Directional antennas
	- Focused, point-to-point connection
- Wireless regulations are complex
	- refer to your country's regulatory agency
- Frequency use
	- unlicensed 2.4GHz or 5 GHz frequencies
	- additional frequencies may be available
	- additional licensing may be required
- Signal strength
	- indoor and outdoor power is usually regulated
- Outdoor antenna installation is not trivial
	- get an expert, be safe

### RFID - Radio-frequency identification
- It's everywhere
	- Access badges
	- inventory/assembly line tracking
	- pet/animal identification
	- anything that needs to be tracked
- Radar technology 
	- Radio energy transmitted to the tag
	- RF powers the tag, ID is transmitted back
	- Bidirectional communication
	- some tag formats can be active/powered

### NFC (Near field communication)
- Two-way wireless communication
	- Build on RFID, which is mostly one-way
- Payment systems
	- Major credit cards
	- Online wallets
- Bootstrap for other wireless
	- NFC helps with Bluetooth pairing
- Access token, identity "card"
	- short range with encryption support

## Wireless Network Technologies

### 802.11 technologies
- Frequency
	- 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz
	- And sometimes both
- Channels
	- Groups of frequencies, numbered by the IEEE
	- Non-overlapping channels would be ideal
- Regulations
	- Most countries have regulations to manage frequency use
	- Spectrum use, power output, interference requi
