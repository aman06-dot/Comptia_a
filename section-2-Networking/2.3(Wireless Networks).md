### 802.11a
- One of the original 802.11 wireless standards
	- October 1999
- Operates in the 5Ghz range
	- Or other frequencies with special licensing
- 54 megabits per second (Mbit/s)
- Smaller range than 802.11b
	- higher frequency is absorbed by objects in the way
- Not commonly seen today

### 802.11b
- Also an original 802.11 standard
	- October 1999
- Operates in the 2.4 GHz range
- 11 megabits per second (Mbit/s)
- Better range than 802.11a
	- less absorption problems
- More frequency conflict
	- Baby monitors, cordless phones, microwave ovens, Bluetooth
- Not commonly seen today

### 802.11g
- An "upgrade" to 802.11b
	- june 2003
- operates in the 2.4 GHz range
- 54 megabits per second (Mbit/s)
	- Similar to 802.11a
- Backwards-compatible with 802.11b
- Same 2.4 GHz frequency conflict problems as 802.11b

### 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)
- The update to 802.11g, 802.11b, and 802.11a
	- October 2009
