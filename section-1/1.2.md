### Portable LCD
- Liquid Crystal Display
	- light shines through liquid crystals
- Advantages
	- light weight
	- relatively low power
	- Relatively inexpensive
- Disadvantages
	- Black level are a challenge
	- requires separate backlight
		- florescent, LED, etc
		- Lights are difficult

### LCD Technologies
- TN (Twisted Nematic) LCD
	- the original LCD technology
	- fast response times (gaming)
	- poor viewing angles-color shifts
- IPS (In plane switching) LCD
	- Excellent color representation
	- More expensive to produce than TN
- VA (vertical alignment) LCD
	- A good compromise between TN and IPS
	- Good color representation
	- slower response times than TN

### OLED
- Organic Light emitting diode
	- organic compound emits light when receiving an electric current
- Thinner and lighter
	- flexible and mobile - no glass needed
- No backlight
	- Thee organic compound provides the light
- Tablets, phones, smart watches
	- very accurate color representation
	- a bit higher cost than LCD

### Wi-fi antennas
- Multiple antennas
	- wi-fi main and aux
	- Bluetooth
- Antenna wires wrap around the laptop screen
	- it's up high!

### Webcam

	- Built-in camera and microphone
- Usually includes both audio and video
	- specialized drivers and software

### Microphone
- Built-in to the laptop display
	- useful for video calls
- Not good for non-casual use
	- analog or USB microphones can help

### Fluorescent vs LED Backlighting
- CCFL- cold cathode fluorescent lamp
	- Higher voltage and power needed
	- added thickness to the display
	- no longer a common backlight
	- older laptops will use these
- LED-backlight is LCD display
	- backlight is  LEDs instead of florescent
	- LEDs around the edge of the screen
	- an array of LEDs behind the screen
	- the latest laptops are LED-backlit
### Backlight and inverter
- LCD displays need a backlight
	- florescent lamp/LED to LCD display to your eyes
