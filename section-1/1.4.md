## Cellular Standards

### Cellular networks
- Mobile devices
	- "Cell" phones
- Separate land into "cells"
	- Antenna coverages a cell with certain frequencies
- 2G networks
	- GSM - Global System for mobile communications
	- CDMA - Code Division Multiple access
- Poor data support 
	- Originally used circuit-switching
	- Minor upgrades for some pocket-switiching

### GSM
- Global System for mobile communications
	- Mobile networking standard
- 90% of the market
	- Originally an EU standard
	- Worldwide coverage
- Used by AT&T and T-Mobile in the United States
	- Move your SIM card (Subscriber Identity Module) from phone to phone
- Original GSM standard used multiplexing
	- Everyone gets a little slice of time

### CDMA
- Code Division Multiple Access 
	- Everyone communicates at the same time
	- Each call uses a different code
	- The codes are used to filter each call on the receiving side
- Used by Verizon and Sprint
	- Handsets are controlled by the network provider
	- Not much adoption elsewhere

### 3G technology
- 3rd Generation
	- Introduced in 1998
- Upgraded data connectivity over 2G
	- incremental 3G updates improved speeds
	- usually several megabits per second
- Bandwidth improvement allowed new functionality
	- GPS
	- Mobile television
	- Video on demand

### 4G and LTE
- Long Term Evolution (LTE)
	- A "4G" technology
	- converged standard (GSM and CDMA providers)
	- Based on GSM and EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution)
	- Standard supports download rates of 150 Mbit/s
- LTE Advanced (LTE-A)
	- Standard supports download rates of 300 Mbit/s

### 5G
- Fifth generation cellular networking
	- Launched worldwide in 2020
- Significant performance improvements
	- AT higher frequencies 
	- Eventually 10 gigabits per second
	- Slower speeds from 100-900 Mbit/s
- Significant IoT impact 
	- Bandwidth becomes less of a constraint
	- Larger data transfers
	- Faster monitoring and notifications
	- Additional cloud processing

### Updates
- PRL updates
	- Preferred Roaming List
	- CDMA networks
	- (i.e., Verizon, Sprint)
- Allows your phone to connect to the right tower
	- Can be updated over the air (OTA)

### Hotspot
- Turn your phone into a Wi-Fi hotspot
	- your own personal wireless router
	- extend the cellular data network to all of your devices
- Dependent on phone type and provider
	- may require additional charges and data costs

## Mobile Device Connectivity

### Bluetooth pairing
- Connect a Bluetooth device
	- Built-in security
	- Use or verify a PIN
- Pair the devices one time
	- future connections should be automatic
- Check with the manufacturer
	- May prefer a specific sequence
	- Discoverable mode isn't always obvious

### Bluetooth pairing process
- Enable Bluetooth on both devices
	- Android and iOS: Settings/ Bluetooth
- Set devices to discoverable mode
	- may require key sequence on Bluetooth device
- Select discovered device
	- many devices may appear!
- Enter or confirm PIN
	- should be the same on both devices
- Test connectivity
	- Devices should now communicate

### GPS(Global Positioning System)
- Created by the U.S. Department of Defense
	- Over 30 satellites currently in orbit
- Precise navigation
	- need to see at least 4 satellites
- Determines location based on timing differences
	- Longitude, latitude, altitude
- Mobile device location services and geo-tracking
	- Maps, directions
	- Determine physical location based on GPS, Wi-Fi and cellular towers

### MDM(Mobile Device Management)
- Manage company-owned and user-owned mobile devices
	- BYOD- Bring Your Own Device
- Centralized management of the mobile devices
	- Specialized functionality
- Set policies on apps, data, camera, etc.
	- Control the remote device
	- the entire device or a "partition"
- Manage access control
	- force screen locks and PINs on these single user devices
- Corporate email configuration
	- User does not need to configure anything 
	- The MDM makes the changes on the device
	- Account details, server address, communication method
- Two-factor authentication
	- Require specific authentication types
	- Biometrics, pseudo-random authentication app
- Corporate applications
	- Allow or restrict app installation
	- Prevent unauthorized app usage
