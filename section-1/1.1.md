	- A challenging repair
- Some laptops are easier to fix than others
	- An ongoing learning process
- Understand the process
	- The details will vary between laptop manufacturers

### Laptop Batteries
- The Power source when unplugged
	- May be easily replaced or required a teardown
	- Five minutes vs one hour
- Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) and Lithium-Ion Polymer(LiPo) are common
	- No "memory effect"
	- Charging the battery diminishes capacity
- Different form factor for each laptop
	- Battery types and styles can vary
	- Battery technology is charging constantly

### Laptop Keyboard
- The most-used component of the laptop
	- can be easy to replace
	- A few screws and a single ribbon cable
	- may not always be this simple
- Or connect an external USB key board

- Some laptop memory is soldered to the system board
	- No upgrade available
	- Requires a full system board replacement

### Laptop Storage
- Magnetic Disk
	- Traditional spinning drive platters 
	- 2.5 form factors (3. inch for desktops)
- SSD (Solid-state drive)
	- All memory, no moving parts
	- Silent, fast access time, less latency
	- 2.5 inch form factors
- M2
	- smaller form factor
	- no SATA data or power cables
	- easy to install and replace

### Replacing laptop storage
- All internal
	- Open a cover on the back
	- Open the entire laptop
- Can be very modular
	- one screw
	- similar to RAM installation
- M2 drives are even easier
- one screw
- similar to RAM installation

### Migrating from HDD to SSD
- An impressive upgrade
	- move from spinning mechanical drive to solid state memory
	- it's almost like getting a new laptop
- Install an OS on the SSD
	- move user documents between drives
	- install any required applications
	- can be time consuming
- Image/Clone the HDD
	- No OS installation required
	- Move everything from one to the another
- Imaging software needed
	- sometimes included with the SSD
	- many commercial and open source options
- Create an image file
	- one drive at a time
- Drive to Drive image
