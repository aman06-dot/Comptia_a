## Troubleshooting Video and Display Issues

### No video image
- Is it connected ?
	- We wouldn't ask if it wasn't a real solution
	- Check both power and signal cable
- Input selection on monitor
	- HDMI, DVI, VGA, etc.
- Image is dim
	- Check brightness controls
- Swap the monitor
	- Try the monitor on another computer
- No video after Windows loads
	- Use VGA mode (F8)

### Image quality problems 
- Flickering, color patterns incorrect
	- You can almost work with this
- Check the cable pins
	- Especially if missing a color
- Distorted image and geometry
	- Check the OS refresh rate and resolution settings
	- Need to match the display specifications
	- Check or replace cable
- Disable hardware acceleration
	- Troubleshoot with the software drivers

### Native resolution
- An LCD display is fixed
	- The number of pixels doesn't change
- A display looks best when the video settings match a display's native resolution
	- A mismatch can cause distortion
- If changing the display resolution , try using a multiple of the native resolution
	- 2560 X 1600 is the same ratio as 1920 X  1200

### Burn-in
- A problem across all monitor types
	- Some displays will pixel-shift
	- You probably won't notice it
- LCDs have "image sticking"
	- Try to remove by displaying a white screen for an extended period

### Dead pixels
- Always black
	- A manufacturing defect
- This probably isn't a problem on your side
	- Not a cable or power issue
- Clean the monitor screen
	- Damp cloth
- You'll have to replace the monitor
	- No other option

### Flashing screen
- Check the video
