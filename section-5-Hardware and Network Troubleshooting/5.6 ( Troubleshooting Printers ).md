## Troubleshooting Printers

### Testing the printer
- Print or scan a test page
	- Built into windows
	- Not the application
- Use diagnostic tools
	- Web-based utilities built into the printer
	- Vendor specific
	- Generic utilities

### Bad output
- Lines down the printed page
	- Inkjet : Clean print heads
	- Laser : Check for scratched photosensitive drum
- Faded prints, blank pages
	- Low toner or ink
- Double/echo images or speckling
	- Laser printer optical drum not cleaned
