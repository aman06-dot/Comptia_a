## Troubleshooting Printers

### Testing the printer
- Print or scan a test page
	- Built into windows
	- Not the application
- Use diagnostic tools
	- Web-based utilities built into the printer
	- Vendor specific
	- Generic utilities

### Bad output
- Lines down the printed page
	- Inkjet : Clean print heads
	- Laser : Check for scratched photosensitive drum
- Faded prints, blank pages
	- Low toner or ink
- Double/echo images or speckling
	- Laser printer optical drum not cleaned properly
	- Ghost or "shadow" from previous drum rotation

### Garbled print
- Bad printer driver / wrong model
	- Incorrect page description language (PCL or PostScript ?)
- Verify the printer functionality
	- Check with a test page
- Bad application
	- Check the output
	- Upgrade the application

### Toner not sticking to the paper
- Laser printer output smudges everywhere
	- Toner sticks to everything
- Toner not fused to the paper
	- Toner should be permanently melted and pressed
	- May not be hot
- Fuser problem
	- Replace the fuser assembly

### Incorrect paper size
- Print a letter size page
	- Accidentally send it to a legal size paper tray
- Printer stops and shows a message
	- Gives you a chance to fix the issue
- Tray selection is provided during the printing process
	- Try printing again
	- Change the defaults in the printer configuration

### Paper jam
- Careful when removing
	- Don't rip the paper
	- Don't damage internal components
- Paper not feeding or misfeeds multiple pages
	- Check the tray
	- Pickup rollers are part of a laser printer maintenance kit
- Creased paper
	- Problems in the paper path
	- Check the paper weight
