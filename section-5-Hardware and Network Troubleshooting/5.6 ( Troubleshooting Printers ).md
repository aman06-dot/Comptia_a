- Use diagnostic tools
	- Web-based utilities built into the printer
	- Vendor specific

	- Laser : Check for scratched photosensitive drum
- Faded prints, blank pages
	- Low toner or ink
- Double/echo images or speckling
	- Laser printer optical drum not cleaned properly
	- Ghost or "shadow" from previous drum rotation

### Garbled print
- Bad printer driver / wrong model

- Bad application
	- Check the output
	- Upgrade the application

### Toner not sticking to the paper
