## Troubleshooting Common Hardware Problems

### POST (Power On Self Test)
- Test major system components before booting the operating system
	- Main systems (CPU, CMOS, etc.)
	- Video
	- Memory
- Failures are usually noted with beeps and/ or codes
	- BIOS versions can differ, check your documentation
- Don't bother memorizing the beep codes
	- They're all different between manufacturers
	- know what to do when you hear them

### POST and boot
- Blank screen on boot
	- Listen for beeps
	- Bad video, bad RAM, bad CPU
	- BIOS configuration issue
- BIOS time and setting
	- Maintained with the motherboard battery
	- Replace the battery
- Attempts to boot to incorrect device
	- Set bot order in BIOS configuration
	- Confirm that the startup device has a valid operating system
	- Check for media in a startup device

### Crash screens
- Windows Stop Error
- Blue Screen of Death
	- You don't want this
- Contains important information
	- Also written to event log
- Useful when tracking down problems
	- Sometimes more useful for manufacturer support

### Bluescreens and spontaneous shutdown
- Startup and shutdown BSOD
	- Bad hardware, bad drivers, bad application
- Use Last known Good, System Restore, or Rollback Driver
	- Try safe mode
- Reseat or remove the hardware
	- If possible
- Run hardware diagnostics
	- Provided by the manufacturer
	- BIOS may have hardware diagnostics

### The spinning ball of death
- The macOS X Spinning Wait cursor
	- Feedback that something is happening
- The spin starts, but it never stops
	- You never get back control of your computer
- Many possible reasons
	- Application bug
	- bad hardware
	- slow paging to disk
- Restart the computer
	- there may be details in the console logs

### Black screen
- Is the monitor connected ?
	- We wouldn't ask if it wasn't a common solution
	- Check both powder and signal cable
- Input selection on monitor
	- HDMI, DVI, VGA, etc.
- Image is dim
	- Check brightness controls
- Swap the monitor
	- Try the monitor on another computer
- No video after windows loads
	- Use YGA mode (F8)

### No power
- No power
	- No power at the source
	- No power from the power supply
	- Get out your multimeter
- Fans spin - no power to other devices
	- Where is your fan power connected ?
	- No POST - bad motherboard ?
	- Case fans have lower voltage requirements
	- Check the power supply output

### Sluggish performance
- Task Manager
	- Check for high CPU utilization and I/O.
- Windows Update
	- Latest patches and drivers
- Disk space
	- Check for available space and defrag
- Laptops may be using power-saving mode
	- Throttles the CPU
- Anti-virus and anti-malware
	- Scan for bad guys

### Overheating
- Heat generation
	- CPUs, video adapters, memory
- Cooling systems
	- Fans and airflow
	- Heat sinks
	- Clean and clear
- Verify with monitoring software
	- Built into the BIOS
	- Try HWMonitor

### Smoke and burning smell
- Electrical problems
	- The smoke makes everything work
- Always disconnect power
	- There should never be a burned odor
- Locate bad components
	- Even after the system has cooled down
	- Replace all damaged components

### Intermittent shutdown
- No warning, black screen
	- May have some details in your event viewer
- Heat-related issue
	- High CPU or graphics, gaming
	- Check all fans and heat sinks
	- BIOS may show fan status and temperatures
- Failing hardware
	- Has anything changed ?
