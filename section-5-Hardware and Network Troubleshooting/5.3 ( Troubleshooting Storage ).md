## Troubleshooting Storage Devices

### Storage failure symptoms

- Read/Write failure
	- "Cannot read from the source disk"
- Slow performance
	- Constant LED activity
	- Retry...retry...retry
- Loud clicking noise
	- The click of death
	- May also include grinding and scraping

### Troubleshooting disk failures
- Get a backup
	- First thing - a bad drive is bad
- Check for loose or damaged cables
- Check for overheating
	- Especially if problems occur after startup
- Check power supply
	- Especially if new devices were added
- Run hard drive diagnostics
	- From the drive or computer manufacturer
	- Preferably on a known-good computer

### Boot failure symptoms
- Drive not recognized, Boot Device Not Found
	- Lights (or not lights)
	- Beeps
	- Error messages
- Operating system not found
	- The drive is there
	- Windows is not

### Troubleshooting boot failures
- Check your cables
	- Physical problem
- Check boot sequence in BIOS
	- Check for removable disks (especially USB)
	- Check for disabled storage interfaces
- For new installation, check hardware configuration
	- Data and power cables
	- Try different SATA interfaces
- Try the drive in a different computer

### Data loss/corruption
- Hard drives are mechanical devices
	- They will eventually fail
- Repairs are difficult and expensive
	- Dust-free environment
	- Not always successful
- An SSD may simply stop working
	- Sometimes can read but not write
- Data becomes unavailable or corrupted
	- Can be impossible to recover
- Always have a backup

### RAID not found
- Missing or faulty RAID controller

### RAID stops working
- Each RAID is different
	- Don't start pulling drives until you check the console !

### RAID recovery
- Each RAID is different
	- Don't start pulling drives until you check the console !

### S.M.A.R.T.
- Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology
	- Use third-party utilities
- Avoid hardware failure
	- Look for warning signs
- Schedule disk checks
	- Built-in to most drive arrays
- Warning signs
	- Replace a drive

### Extended read/write times
- A lot happens when reading or writing data
	- Memory access, communication across the bus, spinning drive access, writing or reading the data to the storage device, etc.
- Delays can occur anywhere along the way
	- Need a way to measure storage device access
- Input/output operatinf
