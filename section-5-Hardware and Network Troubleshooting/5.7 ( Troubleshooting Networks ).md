## Troubleshooting Networks

### No network connectivity
- Do you have a link light ?
	- Is it plugged in ?
- Ping loopback (127.0.0.1)
	- Is the protocol stack working ?
	- Availability and intermittent connectivity
- Ping local IP address
	- Checks local configuration, adapter, and link signal
- Ping default gateway
	- Connectivity on the local network
- Ping devices on router's other side
	- 8.8.8.8 or 9.9.9.9

### Intermittent wireless connectivity
- Interference
	- Something else is using our frequency 
- Signal strength
	- Transmitting signal. transmitting antenna, receiving antenna, etc.
- Incorrect channel
	- Usually automatic; look for manual tuning
- Bounce and latency
	- Multipath interference; flat surfaces
- Incorrect access point placement
	- Locate close to the users

### Wireless interference
- Predictable
	- Fluorescent lights
	- Microwave ovens
	- Cordless telephones
	- High-power sources
- Unpredictable
	- Multi-tenant building
- Measurements
	- Signal to noise ratio (SNR)
	- Performance Monitor

### Signal to noise ratio (SNR)
- Signal
	- What you want
- Noise
	- What you don't want
	- Interference from other networks and devices
- You want a very large ratio
	- The same amount of signal to noise (1:1) would be bad
