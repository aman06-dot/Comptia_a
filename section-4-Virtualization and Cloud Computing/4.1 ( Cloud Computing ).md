## Cloud Models

### Cloud Computing
- More than just a server hosted elsewhere
	- Extend the management of applications and services
- Deploy an infrastructure in minutes
	- Create and tear down as you need
- International scope
	- Deploy in specific parts of the world
- Use only the required resources
	- Cost is based on the amount of use

### Cloud deployment models
- Private
	- Your own virtualized local data center
- Public
	- Available to everyone over the internet
- Hybrid
	- A mix of public and private
- Community
	- Several organizations share the same resources

### Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- Sometimes called Hardware as a Service (HaaS)
	- Outsource your equipment
- You're still responsible for the management
	- And for the security
- Your data is out there, but more within your control
- Web server providers

### Software as a service (SaaS)
- On-demand software
	- No local installation
	- Why manage your own email distribution ? Or payroll ?
- Central management of data and applications
	- Your data is out there
- A complete application offering
	- No development work required
	- Google Mail, Microsoft 365

### Platform as a service (PaaS)
- No servers, no software, no maintenance team, no HVAC
	- Someone else handles the platform, you handle the development
- You don't have direct control of the data, people, or infrastructure
	- Trained security professionals are watching your stuff
		- Choose carefully
- Put the building blocks together
	- Develop your app from what's available on the platform
