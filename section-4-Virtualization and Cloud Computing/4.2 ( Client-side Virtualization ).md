## Client-side Virtualization

### Virtualization
- One computer, many operating systems
	- macOS, Windows 11, Linux Ubuntu, all at the same time !
- Separate OS, independent CPU, memory, network, etc.
	- But really one computer
- Host-based virtualization
	- Your normal desktop plus others
- Standalone server that hosts virtual machines
	- Enterprise-level
- Been around since 1967
	- IBM mainframe virtualization

### Legacy software and operating systems
- Need to run different application version on the same system
	- Run each application instance in a separate VM
- Application only runs on a previous OS version 
	- Create a VM with the older operating system

### Cross-platform virtualization
- Windows / macOS / Linux doesn't do everything
	- Each OS has strengths and weaknesses
- Run different operating systems at the same time
	- Move between each OS seamlessly
	- No rebooting
- Save time and resources
	- One physical computer

### The hypervisor
- Virtual Machine Manager
	- Manages the virtual platform and guest operating systems
- May require a CPU that supports virtualization
	- Can improve performance
- Hardware management
	- CPU
	- Networking
	- Security

### Resource requirements
- CPU Processor Support
	- Intel : Virtualization Technology (VT)
	- AMD : AMD-V
- Memory
	- Above and beyond host OS requirements
- Disk space
	- Each guest OS has it's own image
- Network
	- Configurable on each guest OS ( standalone, NAT, bridged, etc. )
	- Virtual switch

### Sandboxing
- Isolated testing environment
	- No connection to the real world or production system
	- A technological safe space
- Virtualize development process
	- Try some code, break some code, nobody gets hurt
- Additional development features
	- Roll back to a previous snapshot
	- Run additional systems

### Building the application
- Develop
	- Secure environment
	- Writing code
	- Developers test in their sandboxes
- Test
	- A separate virtual environment for testing
	- still in the development stage
	- all of the pieces are put together
	- Does it all work ?

### Hypervisor security
- Hypervisor is a sweet spot for the bad guys
	- No significant vulnerabilities yet
- VM escaping
	- Malware recognizes it's on a virtual machine
	- Malware compromises the hypervisor
	- Malware jumps from one guest OS to another
