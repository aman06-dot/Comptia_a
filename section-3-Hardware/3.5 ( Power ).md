## Computer Power

### WARNING
- Always disconnect from the power source when working on a device
	- Always. Seriously.
- Some devices store a charge in capacitors
	- know how to discharge before touching
- Never connect your body to any part of an electrical system
	- Do not connect yourself to the ground wire of an electrical system
- Respect electricity
	- It does not respect you

### Computer power supply
- Computer uses DC voltage
	- Most power sources provide AC voltage
- Convert 120V AC or 240V AC
	- To 3.3V DC, 5V DC, and 12V DC
- You'll know when this isn't working
	- An important component

### Amp and volt
- Ampere (amp, A) - The rate of electron flow past a point in one second
	- The diameter of the hose
- Voltage (volt, V) Electrical "pressure" pushing the electrons
	- How open the faucet is

### Power
- Watt (W) - Measurement of real power use
	- volts * amps = watts
	- 120V * 0.5A = 60W

### Current
- Alternating current (AC)
	- Direction of current constantly reverses
	- Distributes electricity efficiently over long distances
	- Frequency of this cycle is important
		- US/Canada - 110 to 120 volts of AC (VAC), 60 hertz (Hz)
		- Europe - 220-240 VAC, 50 Hz
- Direct current (DC)
	- Current moves in one direction with a constant voltage

### Dual-voltage input options
- Voltage varies by country
	- US/Canada - 120 volts of AC (VAC), 60 hertz (Hz)
	- Europe - 230 VAC, 50 Hz
- Manually switch between 120 V and 230 V
	- Get your meter !
	- Or use an auto-switching power supply
	- Don't plug a 120 V power supply into a 230 V power source !

### Power supply output
- Different voltages
	- For different components
- Positive and negative voltage
	- Voltage is a difference in potential
	- The electrical ground is a common reference point
	- Depends on where you measure from
- At the front door of your house
	- The second floor is +10 feet
	- The basement is -10 feet
- +12 V
	- PCle adapters, hard drive motors, cooling fans, most modern components
- +5 V
	- Some motherboard components
	- Many components are now using +3.3 V
- +3.3 V
	- M.2 slots, RAM slots, motherboard logic circuits
- +5 VSB
	- Standby voltage
- -12 V
	- Integrated LAN
	- Older serial ports
	- Some PCI cards
- -5 V
	- Available for ISA adapter cards
	- Most cards didn't use it
	- Today's motherboards don't have ISA slots

### 24-pin motherboard power
- Main motherboard power
	- Provides +3.3 V, +/-5 V, and +/-12 V
- 20 pin connector was the original ATX standard
	- 24 pin was added for PCI express power
- You can connect a 24-pin connector to a 20-pin motherboard
	- Some cables are 20-pin + 4-pin

### Redundant power supplies
- Two (or more) power supplies
	- Internal to the server
- Each power supply can handle 100% of the load
	- Would normally run at 50% of the load
- Hot-swappable
