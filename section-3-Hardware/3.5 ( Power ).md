## Computer Power

### WARNING
- Always disconnect from the power source when working on a device
	- Always. Seriously.
- Some devices store a charge in capacitors
	- know how to discharge before touching
- Never connect your body to any part of an electrical system
	- Do not connect yourself to the ground wire of an electrical system
- Respect electricity
	- It does not respect you

### Computer power supply
- Computer uses DC voltage
	- Most power sources provide AC voltage
- Convert 120V AC or 240V AC
	- To 3.3V DC, 5V DC, and 12V DC
- You'll know when this isn't working
	- An important component

### Amp and volt
- Ampere (amp, A) - The rate of electron flow past a point in one second
	- The diameter of the hose
- Voltage (volt, V) Electrical "pressure" pushing the electrons
	- How open the faucet is

### Power
- Watt (W) - Measurement of real power use
	- volts * amps = watts
	- 120V * 0.5A = 60W

### Current
- Alternating current (AC)
	- Direction of current constantly reverses
	- Distributes electricity efficiently over long distances
	- Frequency of this cycle is important
		- US/Canada - 110 to 120 volts of AC (VAC), 60 hertz (Hz)
		- Europe - 220-240 VAC, 50 Hz
- Direct current (DC)
	- Current moves in one direction with a constant voltage

### Dual-voltage input options
- Voltage varies by country
	- US/Canada - 120 volts of AC (VAC), 60 hertz (Hz)
	- Europe - 230 VAC, 50 Hz
- Manually switch between 120 V and 230 V
