## Storage Devices

### Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
- Non-volatile magnetic storage
	- Rapidly rotating platters
- Random-access
	- Retrieve data from any part of the drive at any time
- Moving parts 
	- Spinning platters, moving actuator arm
	- Mechanical components limit the access speed
	- Mechanical components can also break

### Solid-state drives (SSD)
- Non-volatile memory
	- No moving parts
- Very fast performance
	- No spinning drive delays

### 2.5'' SATA interface

### mSATA (Mini-SATA)
- Shrink the SATA drive into smaller devices
	- Same data, different form factor
	- Great for laptops and mobile devices
- Smaller than 2.5'' SATA drives
	- No spinning drive 
	- Allows for different form factors
- Was used briefly
	- Quickly replaced by the m.2 standard

### AHCI vs. NVMe
- SATA was designed for hard drives
	- Uses AHCI (Advanced Host C)
