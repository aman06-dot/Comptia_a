## Storage Devices

### Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
- Non-volatile magnetic storage
	- Rapidly rotating platters
- Random-access
	- Retrieve data from any part of the drive at any time
- Moving parts 
	- Spinning platters, moving actuator arm
	- Mechanical components limit the access speed
	- Mechanical components can also break

### Solid-state drives (SSD)
- Non-volatile memory
	- No moving parts
- Very fast performance
	- No spinning drive delays

### 2.5'' SATA interface

### mSATA (Mini-SATA)
- Shrink the SATA drive into smaller devices
	- Same data, different form factor
	- Great for laptops and mobile devices
- Smaller than 2.5'' SATA drives
	- No spinning drive 
	- Allows for different form factors
- Was used briefly
	- Quickly replaced by the m.2 standard

### AHCI vs. NVMe
- SATA was designed for hard drives
	- Uses AHCI (Advanced Host Controller Interface) to move drive data to RAM
	- SATA revision 3 throughput up to 600 MB/s
	- SSDs need a faster communication method
- NVMe (Non Volatile Memory Express)
	- Designed for SSD speeds
	- Lower Latency, supports higher throughputs
	- Take advantage of NVMe with a M.2 interface

### M.2 interface
- Smaller form factor
	- No SATA data or power cables
- Can use a PCI Express bus connection
	- 4GB/s throughput or faster when using NVMe PCIe X4
- Different connector types
	- Needs to be compatible with the slot key/spacer
	- B key, M key, or B and M key
	- Some M.2 drives will support both

### B-key and M-key
- M.2 doesn't guarantee NVMe
	- Your M.2 interface may be using AHCI
	- Check your documentation
- Your motherboard may only support one type of M.2 key
	- Check the documentation again

### Flash drives
- Flash memory 
	- EEPROM ( Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory )
	- Non-volatile memory
	- No power required to retain data
- Limited number of writes
	- Can still read the data
- Not designed for archival storage
	- Easy t lose or damage
	- Always have a backup

### Optical drives
- Small bumps read with a laser beam
	- Microscopic binary storage
- Relatively media
	- Archival media
- Many different formats
	- CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, Blu-ray
- Internal and external drives
	- For those uncommon application  installations

## RAID

### Data redundancy
- Hard drives store huge amounts of data
	- Important data
- Hard drives are moving components
	- They will eventually break
- What happens to the data when the drive fails ?
	- You can prepare for that
	- Use an array of drives
- RAID is not backup

### RAID
- Redundant Array of Independent Disks
	- They're also inexpensive disks
- Different RAID levels
	- Some redundant, some not

### RAID 0 - Striping
- File blocks are split between two or more physical drives
- High performance
	- Data written quickly
- No redundancy
	- A drive failure breaks the array
	- Raid 0 is zero redundancy

### RAID 1 - Mirroring
