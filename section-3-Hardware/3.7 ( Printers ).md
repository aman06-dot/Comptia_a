## Laser Printers

### Laser printer
- Combine a laser, high voltage, charged ions, powered ink, heat and paper
- Very high quality
- Fast printing speeds
- Very complex
	- Many complex 
	- Requires on-printer memory
	- Messy on the inside

### Imaging drum
- Image is drawn onto a photosensitive drum
	- "Painted" with a laser
- Picks up toner
	- Transfer toner to the paper
- Can be separate from the toner cartridge
	- Or combined

### Fuser assembly
- Heat and pressure
	- Melt plastic toner powder
	- Permanently bond toner to paper

### Transfer belt and roller
- Color laser printers
	- Cyan, yellow, magenta, black
- Four separate toner cartridges
- Image is transferred from all cartridges to the single belt 
	- And then to a single transfer roller

### Pickup rollers
- Pickup paper
	- Should be a single page at a time
	- Problems if no paper is picked up or multiple sheets are picked
- Should be periodically cleaned or replaced

### Separation pad
- Pull just the top sheet from the paper tray
	- Not multiple sheets
- Small and inexpensive
	- Easy to clean or replace

### Duplexing assembly
- Printers usually print on a single side
	- Not both sides simultaneously
- Printing on both sides is a two step process
	- Print side one, print side two
- You need mechanisms to "flip" the page
	- Automatically
- Can be built-in to the printer
	- Or available as an add-on

## Laser Printer Maintenance

### Replacing the toner cartridge
- Look for the messages
	- Low doesn't mean empty
- The toner can also contain the OPC drum
	- Organic Photoconductor drum
	- Sensitive to light; keep it in the bag
- Power down the printer
	- Safety first
- Remove packing strips from the new drum
	- Replace it with the old

### Laser Printer maintenance kit
- Laser printers wear out
	- All those moving parts
	- Heat and pressure
- Standard maintenance kits
	- Replacement feed rollers, new fuser unit, etc. 
- When to perform maintenance ?
	- Check the printer's page counter
- Power down and replace the components
	- Fuser units are HOT
- Reset the page counter when you're done

### Laser printer calibration
- Different toner cartridges print with different densities
	- Some dark, some light
- Laser printer calibration can adjust the density
	- Makes it looks perfect
- Can be automated or a manual process
	- Every printer is different
	- Check the printer manual

### Laser printer cleaning
- Laser printers are dirty
	- All that toner and paper dust
- Check the manufacturer's recommendations
	- Water, isopropyl alcohol (IPA)
	- Don't use harsh chemicals!
- Outside - Damp cloth
- Inside - Wipe dust away
	- Don't use a normal vacuum cleaner or compressed air
	- Wash toner from skin with cold water
	- Clean rollers with IPA

## Inkjet Printers

### Inkjet (ink-dispersion) printer
- Relatively inexpensive technology
- Quiet
- High-resolution
- Expensive ink
	- Proprietary
- Eventually fades
- Clogs easily

### Ink cartridge
- Place drops of ink onto a page
	- Pulled from a set of cartridges
- CMYK
	- Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key (black)

### Print head
- Some consumer printers integrate the print head into the ink cartridge
	- Change the cartridge, get a new print head
- Others separate the ink cartridge from the print head

### Feed rollers
- Pick up and feed paper through the printer
	- Must be clean and not worn
- Duplexing
	- Print on both sides of the paper
	- Included with some printers

### Carriage and belt
- Ink cartridges are moved over the paper
	- Carriage may include its own print head
- Belt moves the carriage back and forth
	- Another moving part

### Inkjet printer calibration
- Align nozzles to the paper
	- Lines should be crisp
	- Colors should align
- Printer includes a calibration option 
	- May need to make minor adjustments

---

## Inkjet Printers Maintenance

### Cleaning print heads
- Small droplets of ink
	- And small holes in a print head
- Clogged heads is a big issue
	- Many printers automatically clean every day
	- Output has streaks or section of missing color 
- Cleaning process can be started manually
	- Only takes a few minutes
- Some print heads / cartridges can be removed
	- Manually cleaning may help

### Replacing inkjet cartridges
- Usually separate colors
	- Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and key (CMKY)
	- Some cartridges will combine these
- Takes seconds to replace
	- Takes a few minutes to calibrate and prepare the cartridge
- Recycle the empty cartridge
	- All plastic

### Inkjet printer calibration
- Align nozzles to the paper
	- Lines should be crisp
	- Colors should not overlap
- Printer includes a calibration option
	- May need to make minor adjustments

### Clearing jams
- Lots of turns and twists
	- A jam is inevitable
- Remove tray paper
	- Any loose paper
- Remove paper from the path
	- Firm pressure, don't rip
- Check for any scraps of paper
	- Remove all loose paper

## Thermal Printers

### Thermal printer
- White paper
	- Turns black when heated
	- No ink !
- Very quiet
	- Almost silent
- Paper is sensitive to light and heat 
	- And clear tape

### Feed assembly
- Pull paper through the printer
	- Relatively small paper path

### Thermal paper
- Paper covered with a chemical
	- Thermochromic paper / thermal paper
	- Changes color when heated
- Cash registers, credit card terminals
	- And quiet areas
- Looks like normal paper
	- Feels a bit different

## Thermal Printer Maintenance

### Thermal paper replacement
- Relatively inexpensive
	- But impossible to substitute
- Different sizes
	- Not like laser printer paper
	- keep a list
- Actual replacement process is easy
	- Simple paper feed
	- Small device

### Cleaning the heating element 
- Liquid cleaner
	- Isopropyl alcohol (IPA)
	- Get a cleaning pen
	- check manufacturer's recommendations
- Swab gently
	- Usually small areas
- Use a cleaning card
	- Cleans the head and paper pathways

### Removing debris 
- Relatively small amount
	- Paper bits and dust
	- No toner !
- Blow out the printer 
	- Take it outside
- Wipe it out 
	- Damp cloth
- Avoid using a vacuum
	- Unless it's designed for computers
		- Resists static buildup / discharge

### Paper sensitivity to heat
- Heat is used to create the output on the thermal paper
	- Moreheat will darken th
