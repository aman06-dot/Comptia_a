## Laser Printers

### Laser printer
- Combine a laser, high voltage, charged ions, powered ink, heat and paper
- Very high quality
- Fast printing speeds
- Very complex
	- Many complex 
	- Requires on-printer memory
	- Messy on the inside

### Imaging drum
- Image is drawn onto a photosensitive drum
	- "Painted" with a laser
- Picks up toner
	- Transfer toner to the paper
- Can be separate from the toner cartridge
	- Or combined

### Fuser assembly
- Heat and pressure
	- Melt plastic toner powder
	- Permanently bond toner to paper

### Transfer belt and roller
- Color laser printers
	- Cyan, yellow, magenta, black
- Four separate toner cartridges
- Image is transferred from all cartridges to the single belt 
	- And then to a single transfer roller

### Pickup rollers
- Pickup paper
	- Should be a single page at a time
	- Problems if no paper is picked up or multiple sheets are picked
- Should be periodically cleaned or replaced

### Separation pad
- Pull just the top sheet from the paper tray
	- Not multiple sheets
- Small and inexpensive
	- Easy to clean or replace

### Duplexing assembly
- Printers usually print on a single side
	- Not both sides simultaneously
- Printing on both sides is a two step process
	- Print side one, print side two
- You need mechanisms to "flip" the page
	- Automatically
- Can be built-in to the printer
	- Or available as an add-on

## Laser Printer Maintenance

### Replacing the toner cartridge
- Look for the messages
	- Low doesn't mean empty
- The toner can also contain the OPC drum
	- Organic Photoconductor drum
	- Sensitive to light; keep it in the bag
- Power down the printer
	- Safety first
- Remove packing strips from the new drum
	- Replace it with the old

### Laser Printer maintenance kit
- Laser printers wear out
	- All those moving parts
	- Heat and pressure
- Standard maintenance kits
	- Replacement feed rollers, new fuser unit, etc. 
- When to perform maintenance ?
	- Check the printer's page counter
- Power down and replace the components
	- Fuser units are HOT
- Reset the page counter when you're done

### Laser printer calibration
- Different toner cartridges print with different densities
	- Some dark, some light
- Laser printer calibration can adjust the density
	- Makes it looks perfect
- Can be automated or a manual process
	- Every printer is different
	- Check the printer manual

### Laser printer cleaning
- Laser printers are dirty
	- All that toner and paper dust
- Check the manufacturer's recommendations
	- Water, isopropyl alcohol (IPA)
	- Don't use harsh chemicals!
- Outside - Damp cloth
- Inside - Wipe dust away
	- Don't use a normal vacuum cleaner or compressed air
	- Wash toner from skin with cold water
	- Clean rollers with IPA

- Relatively inexpensive technology
- Quiet
- High-resolution
- Expensive ink
	- Proprietary
