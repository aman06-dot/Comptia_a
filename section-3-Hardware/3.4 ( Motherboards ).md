## Motherboard Form Factors

### Motherboard form factors
- Physical size
	- Case sizing
- Basic layout
	- Room for small changes
- Power
	- Standard connectors
- Airflow
	- Increasingly important 
- Wikipedia: There are 40 different motherboard types categorized!

### What you need to know
- CompTIA exam objectives:
	- '3.4 - Given a scenario, install and configure motherboards, central processing units (CPUs), and add-on cards."
- Focus on which motherboard would be the best choice for a scenario
	- Memorizing the dimensions of the motherboard probably isn't the most important thing
	- ATX or ITX
- Which motherboard would you choose ?
	- Media center, video editing, thin client, etc.

### ATX form factor
- Advanced Technology Extended
- Standardized by intel in 1995
	- seen may updates over the years
- Power
	- 20 pin connector
	- 24 pin connector, additional 4/8 pin connector

### ITX form factor
- A series pf low-power motherboards
	- Developed by VIA technologies in 2001
	- Small form factor
- Mini -ITX is screw- compatible with ATX
	- Fits almost any enclosure
- Small form factor uses
	- Single-purpose computing, i.e., streaming media

## Motherboard Expansion Slots

### A computer bus
- Communication path
	- A city of technology
- Internal PC growth
	- Independent pathways
- System expansion
	- Additional capabilities

### Conventional PCI
- Peripheral Component Interconnect
	- Nobody ever calls it that
	- Created in 1994
- Many expansion options
	- 32-bit and 64-bit bus width
	- Parallel communication
- A common expansion interface on previous computer generations
	- PCI Express is the newer technology

### 32-bit PCI parallel bus

### PCI Express
- Also known as PCIe
	- Replaces the older PCI standard
- Communicates serially
	- Unidirectional serial "lanes"
	- Slower devices don't slow down everyone
- One, Two, Four, Eight, Sixteen, or thirty-two full -duplex lanes
	- x1, x2, x4, x8, x16, x32
	- "x" is pronounced "by" ("by 4"."by 16")

## Motherboard Connectors

### 24-pin motherboard power
- Main motherboard power
	- Provides +3.3V, +/-5V, and +/-12V
- 20 pin connector was the original ATX standard
	- 24 pin was added for PCI Express power
- You can connect a 24-pin connector to a 20-pin motherboard
	- Some cables are 20-pin + 4-pin

### 4-pin ATX
- 4-pin ATX +12V power
	- ATX12V Advanced Technology Extended motherboards
- Additional 12 volt power for older motherboards
	- Used primarily for CPU 
- May be labeled ATX12V, P4. or CPU
	- And keyed for the appropriate connector

### Storage drive interfaces - SATA

### Headers
- A pin header
	- A simple electrical interface
	- The connector is attached to the header
- Many different uses
	- Power
	- Peripheral connections
	- lights
	- buttons

### Front panel connectors

## Motherboard Compatibility

### Intel and AMD
- Two solid CPU manufacturers
	- The differences are subtle
- Cost
	- AMD tends to be a bit less expensive
- Different sockets
	- The motherboard is designed for a particular CPU
- Choosing a side
	- Historically, AMD is value
