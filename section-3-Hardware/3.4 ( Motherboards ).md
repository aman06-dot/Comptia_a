## Motherboard Form Factors

### Motherboard form factors
- Physical size
	- Case sizing
- Basic layout
	- Room for small changes
- Power
	- Standard connectors
- Airflow
	- Increasingly important 
- Wikipedia: There are 40 different motherboard types categorized!

### What you need to know
- CompTIA exam objectives:
	- '3.4 - Given a scenario, install and configure motherboards, central processing units (CPUs), and add-on cards."
- Focus on which motherboard would be the best choice for a scenario
	- Memorizing the dimensions of the motherboard probably isn't the most important thing
	- ATX or ITX
- Which motherboard would you choose ?
	- Media center, video editing, thin client, etc.

- Communication path
	- A city of technology
- Internal PC growth
	- Independent pathways
- System expansion
	- Additional capabilities

### Conventional PCI
- Peripheral Component Interconnect
	- Nobody ever calls it that
	- Created in 1994
- Many expansion options
	- 32-bit and 64-bit bus width
	- Parallel communication
- A common expansion interface on previous computer generations
	- PCI Express is the newer technology

### PCI Express
- Also known as PCIe
	- Replaces the older PCI standard
- Communicates serially
	- Unidirectional serial "lanes"
	- Slower devices don't slow down everyone
- One, Two, Four, Eight, Sixteen, or thirty-two full -duplex lanes
	- x1, x2, x4, x8, x16, x32
	- "x" is pronounced "by" ("by 4"."by 16")

## Motherboard Connectors

### 24-pin motherboard power
- Main motherboard power
	- Provides +3.3V, +/-5V, and +/-12V
- 20 pin connector was the original ATX standard
	- 24 pin was added for PCI Express power
- You can connect a 24-pin connector to a 20-pin motherboard
	- Some cables are 20-pin + 4-pin

### 4-pin ATX
- 4-pin ATX +12V power
	- ATX12V Advanced Technology Extended motherboards
- Additional 12 volt power for older motherboards
	- Used primarily for CPU 
- May be labeled ATX12V, P4. or CPU
	- And keyed for the appropriate connector

### Storage drive interfaces - SATA

### Headers
- A pin header
	- A simple electrical interface
	- The connector is attached to the header
- Many different uses
	- Power
	- Peripheral connections
	- lights
	- buttons

### Front panel connectors

## Motherboard Compatibility

### Intel and AMD
- Two solid CPU manufacturers
	- The differences are subtle
- Cost
	- AMD tends to be a bit less expensive
- Different sockets
	- The motherboard is designed for a particular CPU
- Choosing a side
	- Historically, AMD is value and Intel is performance
	- This is a dynamic technology segment

### Server motherboards
- Multisocket
	- supports multiple physical CPU packages
	- Split the load
- Memory slots
	- Supports 4+ modules
- Expansion slots
	- Many slots and different sizes
- Overall size
	- Designed for a rack-mounted system
	- Larger ATX-sized system

### Desktop motherboards
- Can range from full-size motherboards to compact or monitor-only systems
	- We can do a lot with increasingly smaller systems
- Single CPU
	- Reduces cost and complexity
- Memory slots
	- Usually two or four
- Expansion slots
	- May have limited options

### Mobile motherboards
- Laptops
	- Small and light
- CPUs
	- Limited in speed
	- Thermal throttling
- Limited system modification
	- Memory, CPU, functionality
- Portability
	- Smaller devices
	- Low power consumption

### System board
- Proprietary
	- Built to fit
- Replacement isn't easy
	- Swap the entire board
	- Most components are on the system board

## The BIOS

### BIOS - Basic input/ Output System
- The software used to start your computer
	- The firmware
	- System BIOS, ROM BIOS
	- ROM or flash memory
- Initializes CPU and memory
	- Build the workspace
- POST
	- Power-On Self-Test
- Look for a boot loader
	- Start the operating system
- ![[Pasted image 20250511101331.png]]

### Legacy BIOS
- The original / traditional BIOS
	- it's been around for more than 25 years
- Older operating systems talked to hardware through the BIOS
	- Instead of accessing hardware directly
- Limited hardware support
	- No drivers for modern network, video, and storage devices

### UEFI BIOS
- Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
	- Based on Intel's EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface)
- A defined standard
	- Implemented by the manufactures
- Designed to replace the legacy BIOS
	- Need a modern BIOS for modern computers
	- Graphical and text-based

## BIOS Settings

### The secret button(s)
- Launching the system setup
	- Del, F1, F2, Ctrl-S, Ctrl-Alt-S
- Hyper-V (Windows 8/10/11)
	- Turn Windows features on and off
- VMware Workstation Player
	- http://www.vmware.com/products/player/
- But not VirtualBox
	- http://www.virtualbox.org
- Many simulators online
	- Search for "UEFI BIOS simulator"

### Fast Startup
- Windows 8, 10 and 11
	- Doesn't actually shut down all the way
	- Starts up so quickly, you can't open the BIOS configuration
- From the windows desktop
	- Hold down shift when clicking Restart
	- Settings / Update & Security / Recovery / Advanced Startup / Restart now
	- System Configuration ( msconfig 
- Interrupt normal boot three times presents the boot option screen

### Important tips
- Make a backup of your BIOS configuration
	- Write detailed notes
	- Take a picture
- Don't make a change unless you're certain of the setting
	- It's difficult to leave it alone
- Did I mention the backup ?
	- It can save a lot of time !

### Boot options
- What happens when you power on ?
	- The BIOS knows
- Disable hardware
	- Unavailable to the operating system
- Modify the boot order
	- Which boots first ?
	- Move to the next in order
	- USB drive, SSD, hard drive

### USB permissions
- A security challenge
	- Very small storage devices
	- Very large capacities
- USB connections
	- Convenient
	- High speed
- US Department of Defense banned USB flash media for 15 months in 2008
	- SillyFDC worm

### Fans
- Computing power creates heat
	- A lot of heat
- Many different cooling fans
	- CPU fan
	- Chassis fans
- Motherboards often include an integrated fan controller
	- And temperature sensors
	- The motherboard increases and decreases the fan speeds

### Secure Boot
- Malicious software can "own" your system
	- Malicious drivers or OS software
- Secure boot
	- Part of the UEFI specification
- Digitally sign known-good software
	- Cryptographically secure
	- Software won't run without the proper signature
- Support in many different operating systems
	- Windows and linux support

### UEFI BIOS protections
- UEFI BIOS protections
	- BIOS includes the manufacturer's public key
	- Digital signature is checked during a BIOS update
	- BIOS prevents unauthorized writes to the flash
- Secure Boot verifies the bootloader
	- Checks the OS bootloader's digital signature
	- Bootloader must be signed with a trusted certificate
	- Or a manually approved digital signature

### Boot Password Management
- BIOS Password / User Password
	- System won't start
	- Need the password to start the operating system
- Supervisor Password
	- Restrict BIOS changes
	- Must use supervisor password to change any BIOS configurations
- Remember your password !
	- Must reset the BIOS to recover

### Clearing a boot password
- Store the BIOS configuration
	- Your settings
- Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
	- A type of memory
	- May be backed up with a battery
- Usually flash memory these days
	- Easily stored and accessed
- Reset with a jumper short (connect) two pins on the motherboard

### The "CMOS" battery
- Not needed for today's flash-based storage
	- Maintains older BIOS configurations
	- May only be used to maintain date/time
- A bad battery will require a BIOS configuration or date / time configuration on every boot
- On older systems, can reset the BIOS configuration by removing the battery
	- Newer computers use a jumper

### Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
- A specification for encryption functions
	- Hardware to help with encryption functions
- Cryptographic processor
	- Random number generator, key generators
- Persistent memory
	- Comes with unique keys burned in during production
- Versatile memory
	- Storage keys, hardware configurations information
- Password protected
	- No dictionary attacks

### Hardware Security Module (HSM)
- Often used in large environments
	- Clusters, redudant
