## Network Cables

### The importance of cable
- Fundamental to network communication
	- Incredibly important foundation
- Usually only get one good opportunity at building your cabling infrastructure
	- Make it good !
- The vast majority of wireless communication uses cables
	- It has to plug in somewhere

### Twisted pair copper cabling
- Balanced pair operation
	- Two wires with equal and opposite signals
	- Transmit+, Transmit- / Receive+, Receive-
- The twist is the secret !
	- Keeps a single wire constantly moving away from the interference
	- The opposite signals are compared on the other end
- Pairs in the same cable have different twist rates 

### Copper cable categories
- ![[Pasted image 20250411112803.png]]

### Coaxial cables
- Two or more forms share a common axis
- RG-6 used in television/digital cable
	- And high-speed Internet over cable

### No plenum
- ![[Pasted image 20250411113023.png]]

### Plenum 
- ![[Pasted image 20250411113123.png]]
- Plenum space
	- Building air circulation
	- Heating and air conditioning system
- Concerns in the case of a fire
	- Smoke and toxic fumes
- Worst-case planning
	- Important concerns for any structure

### Plenum-rated cable
- Traditional cable jacket
	- Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
- Fire-rated cable jacket
	- Fluorinated ethylene polymer (FEP) or low-smoke polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
- Plenum-rated cable may not be as flexible
	- May not have the same bend radius
- Worst-case planning
	- Important concerns for any structure

### Unshielded and shielded cable
- UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)
	- No additional shielding
	- The most common twisted pair cabling
- STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)
	- Additional shielding protects against interference
	- Shield each pair and/or the overall cable
	- Requires the cable to be grounded
- Abbreviations
	- U - Unshielded
	- S - Braided Shielding
	- F - Foil shielding

### (Overall cable) / (individual pairs) TP
- Braided shielding the pairs is S/FTP
- Foil around the cable and no shielding around the pairs is F/UTP

### Direct burial STP
- Overhead cable isn't always a good option
	- Put the cable in the ground
- Provides protection from the elements
	- Designed to be waterproof
	- Often filled with gel to repel water
	- Conduit may not be needed
- Shielded twisted pair
	- Provides grounding
	- Adds strength
	- Protects against signal interference

### Multimode fiber
- Short-range communication
	- Up to 2 km
- Relatively inexpensive light source
	- i.e., LED
- ![[Pasted image 20250415020254.png]]

### Single-mode fiber

## 569A and 568B Colors

### Structured cabling standards
- International ISO/IEC 11801 cabling standards
	- Defines classes of networking standards
- Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA)
	- Standards, market analysis, trade shows, government affairs, etc.
	- ANSI/TIA-568: Commercial Building Telecommunications Cabling Standard
	- http://www.tiaonline.org
- Commonly referenced for pin and pair assignments of eight-conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted pair cabling
	- T568A and T568B

### T568A and T568B termination
- Pin assignments from T568-B standard
	- Eight conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted-pair cabling
- T568A and T568B are different pin assignments for 8P8C connectors
	- Assigns the T568A pin-out to horizontal cabling
- Many organizations traditionally use 568B
	- Difficult to change in mid-stream
- You can't terminate one side of the cable with 568A and the other with 568B
	- This has never been the definition of a Gigabit Ethernet crossover cable

- Not just for hard drives
	- Scanners, tape drives, CD-ROM drives
- Many devices on a single bus
	- 8 on narrow bus, 16 on wide bus
- Very intelligent interface functionality
	- Much of the difficult configuration work is done between the SCSI devices
- Industry longevity
	- Well supported in the enterprise
	- A standard drive for virtual systems
