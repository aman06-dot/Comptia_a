## An Overview of Memory

### What is memory ?
- Random Access Memory (RAM) is the most common
	- But it's not the only kind of memory
- RAM is not referring to hard drive or SSD storage
	- Don't mix the two terms
	- Data is stored permanently on the drive
- Data and programs can only be used when moved to RAM

### RAM (Random Access Memory) slots
- Memory types have changed through the years
	- Driven by standardization and technology
- One of the most important components of your computer
	- Speed, speed, speed
- Every motherboard is different
	- Check your documentation

### DIMM
- DIMM
	- Dual inline memory module
	- Electrical contacts are different on each side
- 64 bit data width

### SO-DIMM
- Small outline dual in-line memory module
	- About half the width as a DIMM
- Used in laptops and mobile devices

### Dynamic Random Access memory
- The memory on the DIMM
- Dynamic
	- Needs constant refreshing
	- Without refreshing, the data in memory disappears
- Random access
	- Any storage location can be accessed directly
	- Unlike magnetic tape

### SDRAM
- Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM)
- SDRAM is synchronous with the common system clock
	- Queue up one process while waiting for another
	- Classis DRAM didn't wait for a clock signal

### It won't fit !

### SDR vs DDR

### Double Data Rate (DDR3) SDRAM
- Twice the data rate of DDR2
	- Larger chip capacities - Maximum 16GB per DIMM
- No backwards compatibility
	- Speed brings sacrifice

### Double Data Rate (DDR4) SDRAM
- Speed increases over DDR3
	- Faster frequencies
	- Maximum 64 GB per DIMM
- Again, no backwards compatibility

### Double Data Rate (DDR5) SDRAM
- Faster data transfers between the memory module and motherboard
	- Maximum of 64GB per DIMM
- The key has moved
	- No backwards compatibility

## Memory Technologies

### Virtual memory
- Different names
	- Virtual RAM, swap file, etc.
- Swap currently unused application data to storage
	- Free up space for other applications
- Managed automatically by the operating system
	- Some configuration settings are available\

### Multi-channel memory
- Dual-channel, triple-channel, or quad-channel
- Memory combinations should match
	- Exact matches are best
- Memory module slots are often colored differently

### Memory that checks itself
- Used on critical computer systems
	- VM servers, database servers, any server 
- Parity memory
	- Adds an additional parity bit
	- Won't always detect an error
	- Can't correct an error
- Error Correcting Code (ECC)
	- detects errors and corrects
