## Network Cables

### The importance of cable
- Fundamental to network communication
	- Incredibly important foundation
- Usually only get one good opportunity at building your cabling infrastructure
	- Make it good !
- The vast majority of wireless communication uses cables
	- It has to plug in somewhere

### Twisted pair copper cabling
- Balanced pair operation
	- Two wires with equal and opposite signals
	- Transmit+, Transmit- / Receive+, Receive-
- The twist is the secret !
	- Keeps a single wire constantly moving away from the interference
	- The opposite signals are compared on the other end
- Pairs in the same cable have different twist rates 

### Copper cable categories

### Coaxial cables
- Two or more forms share a common axis
- RG-6 used in television/digital cable
	- And high-speed Internet over cable

### No plenum

### Plenum 
- ![[Pasted image 20250411113123.png]]
- Plenum space
	- Building air circulation
	- Heating and air conditioning system
- Concerns in the case of a fire
	- Smoke and toxic fumes
- Worst-case planning
	- Important concerns for any structure

### Plenum-rated cable
- Traditional cable jacket
	- Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
- Fire-rated cable jacket
	- Fluorinated ethylene polymer (FEP) or low-smoke polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
- Plenum-rated cable may not be as flexible
	- May not have the same bend radius
- Worst-case planning
	- Important concerns for any structure

### Unshielded and shielded cable
- UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)
	- No additional shielding
	- The most common twisted pair cabling
- STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)
	- Additional shielding protects against interference
	- Shield each pair and/or the overall cable
	- Requires the cable to be grounded
- Abbreviations
	- U - Unshielded
	- S - Braided Shielding
	- F - Foil shielding

### (Overall cable) / (individual pairs) TP
- Braided shielding the pairs is S/FTP
- Foil around the cable and no shielding around the pairs is F/UTP

### Direct burial STP
- Overhead cable isn't always a good option
	- Put the cable in the ground
- Provides protection from the elements
	- Designed to be waterproof
	- Often filled with gel to repel water
	- Conduit may not be needed
- Shielded twisted pair
	- Provides grounding
	- Adds strength
	- Protects against signal interference

## Optical Fiber

### Fiber Communication
- Transmission by light
	- The visible spectrum
- No RF Signal
	- Very difficult to monitor or tap
- Signal slow to degrade
	- Transmission over long distances
- Immune to radio interference
	- There's no RF

### Multimode fiber
- Short-range communication
	- Up to 2 km
- Relatively inexpensive light source
	- i.e., LED

### Single-mode fiber
- Long-range communication
	- Up to 100 km without pocessing
- Expensive light source
	- Commonly uses lasers

### Structured cabling standards
- International ISO/IEC 11801 cabling standards
	- Defines classes of networking standards
- Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA)
